The developed inventory tracking system authenticates users through a password and user-id mechanism, and enables them to add, remove, increase or decrease items in a visually appealing grid view of inventory. The system has an alert system to notify users of low stock levels, which is accessible via a radio button in the settings menu. The four screens of the system are organized in a logical sequence with a consistent color scheme, adhering to Android core application quality documentation. Testing was conducted on various emulated devices to ensure optimal performance on multiple device configurations. Challenges were faced during development, but overcome with online resources. I found creating the login authentication screen enjoyable and is interested in exploring more opportunities to integrate database technologies.
